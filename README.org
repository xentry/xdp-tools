* xdp-tools - Library and utilities for use with XDP

This repository contains the =libxdp= library for working with the eXpress Data
Path facility of the Linux kernel, along with the =xdp-trafficgen= utility and
reusable header code.

The repository contains the following:

- [[lib/libxdp/][lib/libxdp/]] - the =libxdp= library itself - can be built standalone using =make libxdp=
- [[xdp-trafficgen/][xdp-trafficgen/]] - an XDP-based packet generator
- [[headers/xdp/][headers/xdp/]] - reusable eBPF code snippets for XDP (installed in /usr/include/xdp by =make install=).
- [[lib/util/][lib/util/]] - common code shared between the different utilities
- [[packaging/][packaging/]] - files used for distro packaging
- lib/libbpf/ - a git submodule with [[https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf][libbpf]], used if the system version is not recent enough

To compile, first run =./configure=, then simply type =make=. Make sure you
either have a sufficiently recent libbpf installed on your system, or that you
pulled down the libbpf git submodule (=git submodule init && git submodule
update=).

For a general introduction to XDP, please see the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial][XDP tutorial]], and for more BPF
and XDP examples, see the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/bpf-examples][bpf-examples repository]].
