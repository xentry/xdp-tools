* xdp-tools - Library and utilities for use with XDP

This repository contains the =libxdp= library for working with the eXpress Data Path (XDP) facility of the Linux kernel and the =xdp-trafficgen= utility for generating traffic.

** Repository layout
- [[lib/libxdp/][libxdp]] - XDP helper library.
- xdp-trafficgen - XDP-based packet generator.

** Building
The project requires a modern LLVM/clang toolchain, =libelf=, =pkg-config= and =zlib=. If =libbpf= is not installed, fetch the bundled submodule with:

  git submodule update --init --recursive

Run the usual autotools build from the repository root:

  ./configure
  make              # build everything
  make libxdp       # build only the library
  make xdp-trafficgen  # build only the traffic generator
