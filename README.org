* xdp-tools - Library and utilities for use with XDP

This repository contains the =libxdp= library for working with the eXpress Data Path (XDP) facility of the Linux kernel and the =xdp-trafficgen= utility for generating traffic.

- [[lib/libxdp/][libxdp]] - XDP helper library. Build it with =./configure && make libxdp=.
- [[xdp-trafficgen/][xdp-trafficgen]] - XDP-based packet generator. Build it with =./configure && make xdp-trafficgen=.

To build both components, run =./configure= followed by =make=. Ensure a recent =libbpf= is available or fetch the bundled submodule with:

  git submodule update --init --recursive
